# Financial Risk Assessment Model

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Financial Risk Assessment Model using advanced quantitative techniques, machine learning algorithms, and big data processing. It aims to provide accurate risk predictions and portfolio optimization strategies for financial institutions and investors.

Key features include:
- Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) calculations
- Machine learning-based risk prediction models
- Time series analysis for market trend forecasting
- Portfolio optimization using modern portfolio theory
- Interactive data visualizations and dashboards
- API for integration with other financial systems
- Scalable architecture using Docker and Kubernetes

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-risk-assessment.git
   cd financial-risk-assessment
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install the project in editable mode:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```
   cp config/settings.example.py config/settings.py
   ```

2. Edit `config/settings.py` to set up your database connections, API keys, and other configuration parameters.

3. Set up logging by editing `config/logging_config.yaml` according to your needs.

## Usage

### Running Risk Assessments

To run a full risk assessment:

```
python scripts/run_risk_assessment.py
```

### Backtesting Models

To backtest the risk models:

```
python scripts/backtest_models.py
```

### Generating Reports

To generate risk reports:

```
python scripts/generate_reports.py
```

## API Documentation

The project includes a RESTful API for integrating the risk assessment functionality into other systems. 

To start the API server:

```
python -m api.app
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`. 

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the [API Documentation](docs/api_documentation.md).

## Testing

To run the test suite:

pytest
```

For more detailed test output and coverage information:

```
pytest --verbose --cov=financial_risk_assessment
```

## Deployment

### Using Docker

To build and run the Docker container:

```
docker build -t financial-risk-model .
docker run -p 8000:8000 financial-risk-model
```

### Using Kubernetes
